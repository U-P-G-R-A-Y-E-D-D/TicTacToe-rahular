TicTacToe
=========
A simple Java program with a back-propagation neural network which learns to play the classic game of Tic Tac Toe. The program  is basically a set of rules for playing the game with some scaffolding which allows other developers to dynamically include their own algorithms and test it out with the neural network, a genetic algorithm and a hard coded ideal player.
